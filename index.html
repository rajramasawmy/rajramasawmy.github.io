                        If you are an IRTA Fellow or a Visiting Fellow, you will receive your pay monthly on the first weekday of each month. This is automatically deposited to your bank account. Fellows arriving from overseas will need to open a bank account to receive this
                        payment. Stipends start from $43k, but are subject to each PI, and can be increased through experience, academic output and internal grant applications.

                        Some banks (e.g. PNC) may accept applications for a checking account without a SSN (on the assumption you will receive one soon), though this might be difficult for some individuals. The NIH has its own Federal credit union (NIHFCU), which can offer checking
                        and credit accounts for incoming fellows.

                        Be aware that ATMs will charge you for ‘foreign’ bank withdrawals, but credit unions partner with each other and a few other interbank networks to offer withdrawals free-of-charge (e.g. NIHFCU customers have free withdrawals at Navy FCU or Allpoint ATMs).

                <h2>Taxes</h2>

                <body>
                    <p>
                        The USA prides itself on having the most complex taxation system in the world. The Division of International Services (DIS) offers tax courses to guide you through this, and also can be communicated with for specific questions. Here is a brief overview:
                    </p>
                    <p>In the USA, the tax year is from Jan 1st – Dec 31st, and the deadline for returns are filed around mid-April. Some countries have a tax-treaty with the US meaning you don’t have to pay Federal tax whilst on a exchange visa. Note: if
                        you arrive Nov 2016, then you are seen by the IRS as having used up 2016 as the tax exemption year!
                    </p>
                    <p>Even if you are not yet a permanent resident (i.e. Green Card holder), you are still considered a resident FOR TAX PURPOSES if you have lived in the USA for 2 years or more.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the USA, you generally pay income tax to the country’s government (the IRS) and the state’s government (e.g. Maryland, DC, or Virginia). In some cases you have to pay the local county’s government (e.g. Montgomery County) or the
                        city’s government (e.g. Baltimore city). The forms for the IRS are called “1040” and are the same regardless of where you live. The forms for the state, county, and city depend on where you live, not where you work; for example,
                        if you work in Bethesda, MD but live in DC then you will pay state tax to DC. These state taxes are paid quarterly, typically through the states online system - there is a large fine if you dont!
                    </p>
                    <p>You will also need to report other sources of income on your taxes. For example, if you have investments earning interest such as a savings account, even if it is a small amount of money, you will need a statement from your bank with
                        the interest income tax information.

                        Societies at the NIH still use archaic listservs to communicate (expect a lot of spam), but some clubs have information buried within here: <a href="http://govemployee.com/nih/">http://govemployee.com/nih/</a> (also offers discounts,
                        and on-site gym membership) Typically, the best thing to do is ask around, feel free to contact us if you’re interested in a particular club.</p>

                        The NHLBI Labs are located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland (yellow star on the map). Bethesda is a suburb near the Washington, DC area. There is no "NIH Housing", so fellows must find housing on their own. This section is based on renting houses,
                        for other information on buying houses, here is some NIH info: <a href="https://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/executive/recruit/homes.htm">https://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/executive/recruit/homes.htm </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>One bedroom apartments typcially will rent for $1400+/month, while two bedroom apartments will rent for $1800+/month, depending on the location. Most fellows will want to use public transportation. The NIH campus is at the Medical
                        Center station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many places to rent near other Red Line stations. Rentals are cheaper on the Red Line as you go more north of the campus, and more expensive south, towards the center of Washington DC.

                                        cafes, local bars, restaurants in Cleveland Park to the south, Tenleytown to the west, and Chevy Chase to the north, all of which are 10-15min walkin distance. The area is relatively quiet and low key, with few venues for night
                                        life. But livelier neighborhhods are easily accessible by many bus lines or a quick metro ride.

                                        <strong>Living:</strong> Amenities: Downtown Silver Spring has a good collection of restaurants, shops and markets (Safeway, Giant, Whole Foods) and is reasonably walkable if you live downtown. On the weekends there is a nice
                                        farmer’s market and many other vendors on Ellsworth Avenue. There is a great new library downtown as well. Some areas of southern Silver Spring near East-West Highway (MD 410) have access to Rock Creek Park, a huge wooded park
                                        in the midst of DC and the suburbs, which is my favorite thing about living here. There are several smaller parks and playgrounds around the city. Unless you live within a few square miles of downtown you probably want to have
                                        a car to live in Silver Spring.
                                        <p><strong>Summary: </strong> More affordable than Bethesda, but generally more suburban than neighborhoods in DC with red line metro access to NIH campus.</p>
