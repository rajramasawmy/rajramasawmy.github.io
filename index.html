                <p>The Office of Education and the Fellows Advisory Committee welcome you as a future fellow in the Division of Intramural Research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH. </p>
                <p>As a Fellow, you will join a community of over 300 Postdoctoral Fellows whose research spans everything from molecular modeling to clinical studies. The Fellows Advisory Committee (FAC) has put together the following website with information
                    for future fellows to help with your transition to the NIH. In addition we have a &#34buddy&#34 system if you want to be in contact with a current Fellow. If you further questions, please contact rajiv.ramasawmy@nih.gov. </p>
                <p><strong>The information presented here is a quick introduction</strong>, made from what current postdoctoral fellows found helpful before starting here. For more specific cases and information, please consult the links provided or visit:

                        If you are an IRTA Fellow or a Visiting Fellow, you will receive your pay by the 5th business day of each month. This is automatically deposited to your bank account. Fellows arriving from overseas will need to open a bank account to receive this
                        payment. Stipends start from $48,450 (2017), but are up to the discretion of each PI, and can be increased through experience, academic output and internal grant applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Official stipend information can be found here: <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-047.html" target="_blank"> Official stipend information </a>

                    <p>
                        In addition to the stipend, fellows receive a travel subsisdy (parking
                        or metro transport) <a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/pes/dats/Transhare/Pages/transhare.aspx" target="_blank"> (Transhare) </a>.

                        For international Fellows who may not have a US credit or debit card upon arrival to the NIH, be sure to bring enough cash or get a travel cash card for the first few weeks of living costs. All Fellows should come prepared with approximately $5000 for
                        the deposit and first month&#39s rent, as housing can range from $1200-$3000 (see accommodation link) per month. Transferring money directly from internet services such as PayPal or TransferWise may be easier than carrying this
                        much cash. Checks may be used in some situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Postdoctoral fellows receive a $2000 advance to help them with the first month, but that can take a couple of weeks to come through (contact your Administrative Officer, as this may be sent as a check). Predocs and Postbaccs do not typically get an advance but it is possible to request a $1,000 advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>Personal insurance is provided, though not until some paperwork has gone through - so we recommend getting some travel insurance for the first few weeks.</p>

                    <h4> Banking </h4>
                    <p>
                        For international fellows, some banks (e.g. PNC) may accept applications for a checking account without a SSN (on the assumption you will receive one soon), though this might be difficult for some individuals. The NIH has its own Federal credit union
                        (NIHFCU), which can offer checking and credit accounts for incoming fellows, which does not require a SSN to set up an account.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be aware that ATMs will charge you for &#39foreign&#39 bank withdrawals, but credit unions partner with each other and a few other interbank networks to offer withdrawals free-of-charge (e.g. NIHFCU customers have free withdrawals at Navy FCU or Allpoint
                        ATMs).
                    </p>

                    <h4> NIH ID Card </h4>
                    <p> Your priority for getting up and running at the NIH is to get your ID card, which can take some time. This card is needed for campus and computer access, so make this your primary goal!
                      The major hurdle is getting a social security number quickly, once that is being processed you can start the next security steps.
                        <a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/ser/dpsac/badge/Pages/4steps.aspx" target="_blank">NIH Smart card info</a>

                    </p>
                    <h4> Social Security Number </h4>
                    <p>You can apply for a Social Security Number (SSN), three days after you arrive (<a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/pes/dis/VisitingScientists/Documents/ssn_overview.pdf#search=social%20security%20office" target="_blank">more info</a>),
                        at your local Social Security Administration.

                    </p>
                    <h4> Overseas Travel </h4>
                    <p>For J1-visas, you are eligible for international travel, but you require a stamp on your DS-2019 form which is available from the NIH Division of International Services, on campus. Make sure you don't do this last minute as you need
                        all the visa documents to get back in to the US!

                    </p>
                    <h4>Insurance </h4> Fellows receive health insurance with <a href="https://faes.org/content/health-insurance-services" target="_blank"> CoreSource </a> (does not include dental insurance). In order to get this, there is a fellowship "activation" you have to complete after you arrive (this is just chasing down a few signatures!).

            <div id="Taxes" class="w3-container tabRR w3-light-gray" style="display:none">
                <h2>Taxes</h2>

                <body>
                    <p>The Division of International Services (DIS) offers tax courses to guide you through the USA taxation system, and can be communicated with for specific questions. Here is a brief overview: </p>
                    <p>In the USA, the tax year is from January 1st &ndash; December 31st, and your tax return must be filed by mid-April. Some countries have a tax-treaty with the US, meaning you do not have to pay Federal tax while on an exchange visa.
                        Note: If you arrive at the NIH in, for example, November 2016, then you are seen by the IRS as having used up 2016 as the tax exemption year! </p>
                    <p>Even if you are not yet a permanent resident (i.e. Green Card holder), you are still considered a resident FOR TAX PURPOSES if you have lived in the USA for 2 years or more. </p>
                    <p>In the USA, you generally pay income tax to the country&#39;s government (the IRS) and the state&#39;s government (e.g. Maryland, DC, or Virginia). In some cases, you must pay the local county&#39;s government (e.g. Montgomery County)
                        or the city&#39;s government (e.g. Baltimore city). The forms for the IRS are called &#34;1040&#34; (&#34;W2&#34; for research fellows) and are the same regardless of where you live. The forms for the state, county, and city depend
                        on where you live, not where you work; for example, if you work in Bethesda, MD but live in DC then you will pay state tax to DC. </p>
                    <p>Note: For IRTA&#39;s, taxes are not taken out of your monthly stipend. Therefore, you must file estimated taxes at the state and federal level and pay these estimated taxes quarterly (there is a large fine if you do not!) </p>
                    <p>You will also need to report other sources of income on your taxes. For example, if you have investments earning interest such as a savings account, even if it is a small amount of money, you will need a statement from your bank with
                        the interest income tax information. </p>

                    <h4>Parental Leave </h4>
                    <p>For NHLBI IRTA’s and visiting fellows, twelve weeks of paid leave will be granted to either parent for the birth or adoption of a child. Fellows are eligible to enroll their children in the <a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/pes/dats/childcare/centers/Pages/centers.aspx"
                            target="_blank">NIH Child Care Centers</a>; however, space is extremely limited with an extensive waitlist. You are eligible to register on the waitlist as soon as you know you are expecting, but it is essential to find alternative
                        childcare in the event that a spot does not become available by the time you would need childcare. There is a Child Care Resource and Referral Service available to fellows, which can help you locate childcare facilities. </p>

                    <p>Additionally, fellows can participate in the <a href="https://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/HealthAndWellness/Pages/lactation.aspx" target="_blank">Nursing Mothers Program</a>, which provides prenatal breastfeed education classes, telephone
                        support during maternity leave, consultation upon returning to work, and access to the lactation rooms available on campus for mothers who wish to continue breastfeeding upon their return to work. Please note that fellows do not
                        qualify for the NIH child care subsidy or NIH back-up care services.

                    <h4> Driving Licenses </h4>
                    <p>Driving licenses are obtainable from the DMV. If you have a valid home-country license, it is not necessary to turn in your license - one can take the American theory test (a 25-question multiple-choice exam performed at the center)
                        and pay for an international driving permit. Note that this is tied to your visa, i.e. if your visa is renewed every year, then the license will expire each year accordingly.

                        The NHLBI Labs are located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland (yellow star on the map). Bethesda is a suburb near the Washington, DC area. There is no "NIH Housing", so fellows must find housing on their own. This section is based on renting houses,
                        for other information on buying houses, here is some NIH info: <a href="https://jobs.nih.gov/vacancies/recruit/homes.htm" target="_blank">https://jobs.nih.gov/vacancies/recruit/homes.htm </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>One bedroom apartments typcially will rent for $1400+/month, while two bedroom apartments will rent for $1800+/month, depending on the location. Most fellows will want to use public transportation. The NIH campus is at the Medical
                        Center station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many places to rent near other Red Line stations. Rentals are cheaper on the Red Line as you go more north of the campus, and more expensive south, towards the center of Washington DC.</p>

                                        You will not find any of the typical fast food chains (McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, etc.) in this area. Bars range from cheaper sports bars to more expensive places with extensive beer, wine, and cocktail
                                        lists. Many places offer happy hours which are often found on dchappyhour.com. The Spotluck app is also useful for discounts on restaurants in Bethesda and DC. Food options in this area become very limited after
                                        10 pm on weeknights. Though several places offer dancing on weekends, there are currently no true night clubs in Bethesda. There are several street fairs throughout the year including Taste of Bethesda and the Fine
                                        Arts Festival as well as year round (weather permitting) farmer&#39;s markets. Several small to midsize stage venues also host a variety of entertainment programming throughout the year.

                                        <strong>Living:</strong> Amenities: Downtown Silver Spring has a good collection of restaurants, shops and markets (Safeway, Giant, Whole Foods) and is reasonably walkable if you live downtown. On the weekends there
                                        is a nice farmer&#39;s market and many other vendors on Ellsworth Avenue. There is a great new library downtown as well. Some areas of southern Silver Spring near East-West Highway (MD 410) have access to Rock Creek
                                        Park, a huge wooded park in the midst of DC and the suburbs, which is my favorite thing about living here. There are several smaller parks and playgrounds around the city. Unless you live within a few square miles
                                        of downtown you probably want to have a car to live in Silver Spring.
                                        <p><strong>Summary: </strong> More affordable than Bethesda, but generally more suburban than neighborhoods in DC with red line metro access to NIH campus.</p>

                                <h3>Cardiovascular Interventions Program</h3>
                                <p>I'm a currently a second year postdoc, my research focuses on developing MRI to guide catheter cardiovascular interventions. I've learned a lot since arriving here, and the labs here at the NHLBI are a great place to do
                                    fun and novel research! The NIH is committed towards training postdocs on their next stage, and I warn you, the moment you set foot here everyone is asking where you're going next! I found this website a useful resource
                                    for considering scientific careers: <a href="http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/" target="_blank">http://myidp.sciencecareers.org/</a></p>
                                <p>Having completed my PhD in the UK, and never having visited DC before moving here - I was lucky to have a good friend already here who helped me settle in to the city, I found my apartment in Capitol Heights/ H-street corridor
                                    through Craigslist. It is really great to be so close to the centre of DC - which I enjoy cycling around using the bikeshare system <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/" target="_blank">https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/</a>,
                                    and there are many bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance. It takes me approximately one hour door-to-door to commute using the Metro, which I'm quite used to from London! </p>
                                <p>I love playing soccer, and through a series of NIH email listservs and meetup groups <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">(https://www.meetup.com/)</a> I've managed to find lots of games around DC and Maryland.
                                    Meetup is also a great way of seeing events around the city, including music and hiking. </p>

                                <p>I'm currently a research fellow in the Laboratory of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases. My research focuses on studying metabolic disorders that involve complex regulatory networks of protein coding genes and long non-coding
                                    RNAs (lncRNAs). My long-term goal is to translate my observations into novel therapeutic interventions for human diseases. NHLBI has a world class research environment and full of kind and supportive colleagues. I have
                                    had a great training experience in NHLBI, which has enabled me to get an NIH K22 grant (which is special to NHLBI) to startup my future lab, and I'm ready to move to my next step. </p>
                                <p>Montgomery county is a beautiful place and you can find a nice apartment easily. I enjoyed my stay in Congressional Towers and Rollins Park. More than half of people live there are working in NIH! It takes me about 30-40
                                    minutes door-to-door to commute using the metro, bike, or car. </p>

              <h3>Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Imaging</h3>
              <p>I spent four years as a postdoctoral fellow in the Biochemistry and Biophysics Center before moving on to a data scientist position at Northrop Grumman in 2017.  My research focused on better understanding the spatial organization and temporal dynamics of proteins and lipids regulating insulin secretion from beta cells.  The resources here, both the equipment and technical expertise, are world-class.  These resources, the ability to devote all your time to research, and career services from the NHLBI and OITE are some of reasons that the NHLBI is a great place to do postdoctoral research.  </p>
              <p>I found my apartment in Silver Spring, MD through Craigslist.  My commute is about 30 minutes by bicycle, predominantly on the Capital Crescent or Rock Creek trails, and its great!  The network of bike paths and rail trails (find out more on <a href="https://www.waba.org" target="_blank">www.waba.org</a>)
                                    is one of my favorite things about living in this area. More generally Rock Creek Park in D.C. offers a surprisingly nice array of walking paths, hiking, and other outdoor activities that are very accessible from almost

                                <p>I am a third year postdoc and my research is focused on the role of neutrophils in early atherogenesis. My experience at the NIH has been a very exciting and unforgettable one that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>
                                <p>I have found NHLBI to be a very collaborative environment, with an expert right around the corner no matter what topic you are interested in. There are more programs than I can count that offer training tools, classes,
                                    career development etc. How involved you want to be is really up to you.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, my lab has become my second family, as we work hard, support each other and even spend time together outside of the laboratory setting. Outside of lab, I really enjoy running, biking and hiking, and it is
                                    nice because there are always people around you that love to do the same!</p>

              <p>I am a biochemist studying bioenergetic regulation, and I am in my third year of my second postdoc. I love being able to do innovative big-picture research here at the NHLBI, with access to the best technologies and experts on campus as well as through collaborations around the globe. As a trainee at the NIH, I have also taken advantage of the huge array of classes and career development opportunities, though the NHLBI Office of Education, the OITE, FAES, the NIH Library, and many more.</p>
              <p>When I arrived, I first lived in a house in Clarksburg that I found on Zillow and traveled about 45 min door-to-door with the RideOn commuter bus from a Park-n-Ride in Germantown. The house was very spacious, new, quiet, safe, and adjacent to a park with forest and a creek. Next, I moved to Van Ness in DC so that I could enjoy all the city has to offer, where I lived in a studio in a big apartment block, and traveled about 30 min door-to-door using the metro that I could walk to. Currently, I live in Bethesda in a group house, which I found on Craigslist, and get to walk or bike just 2 blocks to get to work. I am saving a bunch of money and there's never a dull moment sharing a house with three other young professionals! </p>
              <p>I had a much better time at the NIH after I made some friends, which started with going to the FelCom happy hours that I found out about from emails sent to the fellows listserve (FELLOW-L@LIST.NIH.GOV). They arrange various activities and so does the Visiting Fellows Advisory Council (see their Facebook page!). I try to do fun things in the city, get out into nature, work on creative hobbies, and have some "me time" as much as my work schedule allows, and I recommend you do the same for your sanity!</p>
