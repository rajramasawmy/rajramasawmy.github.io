    Welcome to the NHLBI!
  </h1>
    <p>The Office of Education and the Fellows Advisory Committee welcome you as a future fellow in the Division of Intramural Research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH. </p>
    <p>As a Fellow, you will join a community of over 300 Postdoctoral Fellows whose research spans everything from molecular modeling to clinical studies. The Fellows Advisory Committee (FAC) has put together the following information for future fellows to help their transition; in addition we have a ‘buddy’ system to help you if you have any further questions: please contact rajiv.ramasawmy@nih.gov. </p>
    <p><strong>The information presented here is a gentle introduction </strong>, for more specific cases and information consult the links provided. We’ve tried to condense the information here, and minimize paragraphs of links, but if you prefer information overload and hundreds of tabs go to: <a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/assets/Moving_Guide.pdf">https://www.training.nih.gov/assets/Moving_Guide.pdf</a> </p>

    If you are an IRTA Fellow or a Visiting Fellow, you will receive your pay monthly on the first weekday of each month.  This is automatically deposited to your bank account.  Fellows arriving from overseas will need to open a bank account to receive this payment.

    Stipends start from $43k, but are subject to each PI, and can be increased through experience, academic output and internal grant applications.

    Bring enough cash or get a travel cash card, for the first few weeks of living costs.
    Most importantly have on the order of $5000 available money for the deposit and first month’s rent, it may be easier to transfer directly from internet services such as PayPal or TransferWise rather than carry this much cash (checks are virtually phased out nowadays)!
  </p><p>Fellows may apply for a $2000 advance to help them with the first month, but that can take a couple of weeks to come through (Contact your Administrative Officer).</p?>

      Some banks (e.g. PNC) may accept applications for a checking account without a SSN (on the assumption you will receive one soon), though this might be difficult for some individuals.
      The NIH has its own Federal credit union (NIHFCU), which can offer checking and credit accounts for incoming fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be aware that ATMs will charge you for ‘foreign’ bank withdrawals, but credit unions partner with each other and a few other interbank networks to offer withdrawals free-of-charge (e.g. NIHFCU customers have free withdrawals at Navy FCU or Allpoint ATMs).

  <h2>Taxes</h2>
  <p>
    The USA prides itself on having the most complex taxation system in the world. The Division of International Services (DIS) offers tax courses to guide you through this, and also can be communicated with for specific questions. Here is a brief overview:
  </p><p>In the USA, the tax year is from Jan 1st – Dec 31st, and the deadline for returns are filed around mid-April. Some countries have a tax-treaty with the US meaning you don’t have to pay Federal tax whilst on a exchange visa. Note: if you arrive Nov 2016, then you are seen by the IRS as having used up 2016 as the tax exemption year!
    </p><p>Even if you are not yet a permanent resident (i.e. Green Card holder), you are still considered a resident FOR TAX PURPOSES if you have lived in the USA for 2 years or more.
    </p><p>In the USA, you generally pay income tax to the country’s government (the IRS) and the state’s government (e.g. Maryland, DC, or Virginia). In some cases you have to pay the local county’s government (e.g. Montgomery County) or the city’s government (e.g. Baltimore city). The forms for the IRS are called “1040” and are the same regardless of where you live. The forms for the state, county, and city depend on where you live, not where you work; for example, if you work in Bethesda, MD but live in DC then you will pay state tax to DC.
    </p><p>You will also need to report other sources of income on your taxes. For example, if you have investments earning interest such as a savings account, even if it is a small amount of money, you will need a statement from your bank with the interest income tax information.

    Accomodation

  <p>
    The NHLBI Labs are located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland (yellow star on the map). Bethesda is a suburb near the Washington, DC area. There is no "NIH Housing", so fellows must find housing on their own.
This section is based on renting houses, for other information on buying houses, here is some NIH info: <a href="https://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/executive/recruit/homes.htm">https://hr.od.nih.gov/workingatnih/executive/recruit/homes.htm </a>
</p><p>One bedroom apartments typcially will rent for $1400+/month, while two bedroom apartments will rent for $1800+/month, depending on the location.
Most fellows will want to use public transportation.  The NIH campus is at the Medical Center station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro.
</p><p>There are many places to rent near other Red Line stations.  Rentals are cheaper on the Red Line as you go more north of the campus, and more expensive south, towards the center of Washington DC.
